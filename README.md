1. LR (Logistic Regression), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
2. CART (Decision Tree), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
3. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
4.  BAG (Bootstrap Aggregating), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
5.  RF (Random Forest), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
Therefore, in general, Cluster Sampling is the most effective sampling technique.
